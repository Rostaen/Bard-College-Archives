			<h2>Special Collections</h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					Special Collections are made up of books, and are understood to be distinct from the archival collections of the College. Most of these books are searchable in the <a href="https://library.bard.edu/search?/dspec+coll/dspec+coll/-3%2C0%2C0%2CB/exact&FF=dspecial+collections&1%2C971%2C/indexsort=-">online catalog</a>, but access to the majority of these materials requires that a library staff member retrieves the title. These materials cannot be removed from the building. If you are interested in viewing these materials, please visit the Reference Desk, contact the archivist at tieger@bard.edu, or fill out a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFEmbSSY6Ak5dWSZ4tJ7_1BHmdNd8VqDIuWzaiZqrYcQpQOA/viewform?c=0&w=1">Special Collections Request Form</a>.  Following is a brief description of each of  book collections with access specifications.

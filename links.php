					<a href="https://www.bard.edu/montgomeryplace/">Montgomery Place</a> - Montgomery Place, a 380-acre estate adjacent to the main Bard College campus and overlooking the Hudson River, is a designated National Historic Landmark set amid rolling lawns, woodlands, and gardens, against the spectacular backdrop of the Catskill Mountains. Renowned architects, landscape designers, and horticulturists worked to create an elegant and inspiring country estate consisting of a mansion, farm, orchards, farmhouse, and other smaller buildings. The Montgomery Place estate was owned by members of the Livingston family from 1802 until the 1980s. In 1986, Livingston heir John Dennis Delafield transferred the estate to Historic Hudson Valley in whose hands it remained until 2016, when Bard College acquired the property.

					<a href="http://apps.hudsonvalley.org/american-arcadia/" target="_blank">American Arcadia</a> - The American Arcadia project was written in 2011 by staff of Historic Hudson Valley and was supported in part from a grant by the National Endowment for the Humanities.  The introduction reads: "The American Arcadia project newly interprets Montgomery Place through the lens of American environmental history, with particular focus on the women who shaped the property. Through rarely-seen images and other resources, the ten parts of American arcadia provide in-depth content and context for the people, landscape, and architecture of Montgomery Place."

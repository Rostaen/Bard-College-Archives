		<h2>Online Exhibits</h2>
		<p class="italic">Most of the exhibits presented here document aspects of College History, including alumni/ae or faculty profiles, oral histories, collections of artwork or music files and exhibits about Bard as a place and an institution. Some were created by students for class projects; others represent online versions of physical exhibits held in the Library, at Montgomery Place, or elsewhere at the College; and still others are born-digital exhibits originally created for the archives website as part of an exhibit series called 'Voices of Bard.'</p>
